                <p>This site is the skewed mirror of a role-playing game I'm playing with my friends, but I aim to make it as accessible as possible for outsiders as well.</p>

                <p>The game takes place in a parallel universe, very similar to ours, with one important difference: the fundamental laws of nature have been discovered to be guided and enforced by an external force that is both measurable and, to some degree, malleable.</p>
                <p>Throughout history, the manipulation of this external force was practiced as symbolic rituals by esoteric religions and used by the occasional mystic to preform miracles; but only towards the end of the 17th century was it scientifically discovered by one Isaac Newton, who named it "The Pulse".</p>
                <p>The Church of England was quick to pronounce The Pulse the ultimate proof of the existence of God, and by the order of King Charles II, the entire Royal Society turned into a secret lab for studying it and for synthesizing a new religion, Catholic and reformed, with a closely knit hierarchy, and dedicated to the proposition that miracles־on־demand is something that should be monopolized. And so successful was this new religion, so virulent, that it quickly took by storm not only England, not only the world, but well beyond.</p>
                <p>Most people still live on Earth, under the Church's thumb and watchful eye, where heretics are a persecuted minority. But with the ability to defy gravity, space exploration came sooner and developed faster. Humanity has spread all over the solar system, on planets, moons, space stations, and even asteroids (or 'rhoids, as the bitter inhabitants call them) that were lassoed into orbits. And while most of those pioneers depend on religious technology to keep them alive, the Church's control grows weaker with distance from the centralized power of Earth, and there are more and more people who do not believe The Pulse actually has a plan. Or even that it should be capitalized. People who consider it to be just another natural phenomenon, and use it as such.</p>
                <p>Recently, The Church, in its investigations of The Pulse, discovered a strong anomaly on a remote mining asteroid, and have interpreted it, according to ancient prophecies, to indicate that the living avatar of The Pulse, a messianic figure from early Pulsist theology, was born on one of those remote asteroids. The Church, unable to ignore this omen, but unwilling to disturb the status quo over it, sends the most unlikely pilgrim to welcome him.</p>

                <p>Sariputra was born in the City of Westminster, orphaned at an early age, and raised in a temple, as most orphans are. From the very beginning, Sariputra showed great promise and devotion, but he kept asking the wrong questions, and by the age of 13 he was sent to a remote monastery dedicated to some of the more esoteric teachings of the United Church. As the story begins he is 17, still a devout believer and a talented acolyte, who is suddenly assigned a dangerous mission which no one else wants to undertake, and which very few wish to see fulfilled. He, naturally, considers this the highest honor.</p>
                <p>It is our plan, in the game, to see Sariputra lose his immaculate faith, and find something else instead.</p>

                <p>The guiding principle of this game is running it without any secrets. This does not mean that there will be no surprises, it only that we everyone gets surprised together. This means we all try to share our knowledge, guesses and plans for the game as quickly as possible. Release early, release often.</p>
                <p>And since we want to keep this site accessible, and even cool, to outsiders, there will be a lot of editing and polishing and playing some scenes more than once. To the tech geeks among us I will add that the site sits in a git repository, so we have an infinite undo stack and the ability to fork the game and explore different possibilities.</p>
                <p>Buzzwords: Rules, their manipulation and breakage. Faith, loss of. Sequential and non־linear prose, examination of.
